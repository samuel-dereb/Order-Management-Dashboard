Customer Order Managment Dashboard
## Running the Application

1. Install `Node.js 8.9` or higher.  
IMPORTANT: The server uses ES2015 features AND the Angular CLI so you need this version of Node.js!!!!*

1. Run ```npm install```

1. Run ```ng build --watch``` to build and bundle the code

1. Run ```npm start``` in a separate terminal window to build the TypeScript, watch for changes and launch the web server

1. Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser 

Once the app is running you can play around with editing customers after you login. Use any email address and any password that's at least 6 characters long (with 1 digit).

## Running Angular Playground

This application includes Angular Playground (http://www.angularplayground.it) which provides a great way to isolate components in a sandbox rather than loading the entire application to see a given component. To run the playground run the following command:

```npm run playground```
